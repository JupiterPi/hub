# JupiterPi Hub / Personal Website

The Hub is my personal website at [jupiterpi.de](https://jupiterpi.de).

It currently contains: 
- introduction and social/email links
- small portfolio of software projects

More features are planned:
- portfolio of music


## Major features planned

I am planning to later add some major features:
- **Links**: Dynamic shorthand links such as `jupiterpi.de/some-thing-i-found` for personal purposes.
- **Files**: Platform for me to share downloadable archives with people, or request file transfers from people.
